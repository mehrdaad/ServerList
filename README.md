## 📙 Description
TEST

## 📌 Add a Server
First, create a folder for your server's domain in the `servers`-folder. Folder names are always the reversed domain seperated by dots and then the port.

For example, if you want to add the server on domain `example.net` and port `19132`, create the following folder schema:

```
servers (already exists)
    net
        example
            19132
```

Then, create the files `name.txt` and `description.txt` in your subfolder. Put the name of your server into `name.txt` and a description into `description.txt`. Both files may only have one line.

To make it easier to understand, we've created this example in the `example`-folder.

## 🗑 Report outdated Servers
If a server doesn't exist anymore or is only available on a very old version for a long time, feel free to open an issue. We'll check it and remove the server from the list if it's correct.

## 🏗 Use the Data
Our script generates always generates a JSON-file containing all servers including their IP address, port, name and description. You can get it with the [CircleCI-artifacts](https://circleci.com/gh/mpnetzwerk/ServerList) of each build, preferably via the CircleCI-API.

The JSON-file is built like this:

```json
[
    {
        name: "First Test Server",
        description: "A great server",
        ip: "play.testone.com",
        port: 19132
    },
    {
        name: "Second Test Server",
        description: "Another great server"
        ip: "play.testtwo.com",
        port: 19133
    },
    ...
]
```
